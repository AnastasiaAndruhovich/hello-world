## Compose sample application

### Use with Docker Development Environments

You can open this sample in the Dev Environments feature of Docker Desktop version 4.12 or later.

### React application with a Spring backend and a MySQL database

Project structure:
```
.
├── backend
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ...
├── db
│   └── password.txt
├── compose.yaml
├── frontend
│   ├── ...
│   └── Dockerfile
└── README.md
```

[_compose.yaml_](compose.yaml)
```
services:
  backend:
    build: backend
    ...
  db:
    # We use a mariadb image which supports both amd64 & arm64 architecture
    image: mariadb:10.6.4-focal
    # If you really want to use MySQL, uncomment the following line
    #image: mysql:8.0.27
    ...
  frontend:
    build: frontend
    ports:
    - 3000:3000
    ...
```
The compose file defines an application with three services `frontend`, `backend` and `db`.
When deploying the application, docker compose maps port 3000 of the frontend service container to port 3000 of the host as specified in the file.
Make sure port 3000 on the host is not already being in use.

> ℹ️ **_INFO_**
> For compatibility purpose between `AMD64` and `ARM64` architecture, we use a MariaDB as database instead of MySQL.
> You still can use the MySQL image by uncommenting the following line in the Compose file
> `#image: mysql:8.0.27`

## Deploy with docker compose

```
$ docker compose up -d
```

## Expected result

After the application starts, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

Stop and remove the containers
```
$ docker compose down
